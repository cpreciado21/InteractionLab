=======

These are all projects done for my Interaction Lab course in Shanghai. Nearly all the programs utilize an Arduino, Processing, and sensors. 

Videos and documentation can be found here http://ima.nyu.sh/documentation/author/cmp642/

The one project that showcases everything learned is the Harry Potter Final Project.
Link to the video of it working is here: https://youtu.be/l4Qc__OJ7_k

Some of it was created or based on sample code provided in the course or in libraries from Processing and Arduino.
